          I have 17+ years of industry experience as a software engineer, architect and engineering leader.
          I have built geographically distributed, mission critical systems supporting enterprise SaaS clients as well as direct digital consumers.
          I have considerable experience in leading and delivering cloud projects using AWS,
          low latency Advertising Platforms (DSPs), big data and ML platforms using best of breed OSS, devops and observability tools
        </p>
        <p>
          I have built software products from the ground up taking them from 0->1, like I have done at
          ADP and R/GA for Nike+ MAPS as well as taken existing product and platforms from 1->n at both ADP, Tremor Video as well as MLB.

          More recently I have scaled core parts of the Lifion platform at ADP enabling to successfully
          onboard marquee clients of both small and medium sizes helping with the long term viability
          and success of the platform.

          I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
          I'm most attracted to solving real problems with a strong business impact.

          <li>
            Helped Tremor Video's revenue grow from 30-40% YOY by transforming a legacy monolithic architecture to a modern microservices architecture,
            doubling bidding capacity while 50% reduction in latencies - 110K bid requests per second, 60 ms average bid latencies.
            Increased 5x in Ad Serving capacity while cutting latencies by 60%
          </li>
          <li>
            Drove Tremor’s Big Data and ML systems from daily batch based systems to near real time systems providing fast reporting, speedy model generation
            and better budget control during bidding
          </li>
          <li>
            Scaled ADP Lifion's workflow systems with capability to process upto 300k concurrent transactions. Re-architected the system to a cloud-native,
            performant, resilient architecture capable of handling 4x more data transfers with 3x improvements in executing each workflow stage executions
