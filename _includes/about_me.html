          I have over 18 years of industry experience as a software engineer, architect including 10 years of technical and engineering leadership with scope spanning multiple teams and groups.
          I have deep experience building large-scale, distributed systems handling over a million TPS at low latencies, streaming TB/s of data/hour with PBs being stored and processed for AI/ML and analytics, all operating at 99.99% reliability.
          I have considerable experience in leading and delivering cloud projects using AWS with some GCP and Azure.
          I have proven track record of driving change and tech strategy at Series C/D Startups to Fortune 500 companies while collaborating with folks from engineering to product, marketing, support, and C/Executive folks.

          I have built software products from the ground up taking them from 0->1, like I have done at
          Dataminr, Axon and R/GA for Nike+ MAPS as well as taken existing product and platforms from 1->n at both ADP, Tremor Video as well as MLB.
          More recently, as Technical Lead for Dataminr’s AI Platforms and Data Infrastructure domain I drove the architecture of our real-time enrichment and AI/ML pipelines processing over a million TPS, to be more efficient, and automated and save over 5 million USD in annual infra costs working cross-functionally across AI Platform Engineering teams

          I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
          I'm most attracted to solving real problems with a strong business impact.
